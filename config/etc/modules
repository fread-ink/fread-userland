# /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
#
# This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
# at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.

# waveform module
eink_fb_waveform

# note that the mxc_epdc_fb module is loaded by /etc/init.d/graphics
# because loading that module inhibits downloading the waveform data from the
# electronic paper display's flash chip, so we need to ensure that it has
# already been downloaded (or trigger a download if it has not)
# before loading mxc_epdc_fb

# button inputs
